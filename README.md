# Riemman Sum Calculator

## A mathematical tool designed to compute left, midpoint, right riemman sums.

The following is addressed in this README:
- Limitations
- What will this application do?
- Example uses of the application

### 1. Limitations

Currently, the Riemman Sum Calculator can only compute functions of the type
- Fundamental trigonometric operations (sin, cos, tan)
- log and ln(x)
- linear functions (supported in RPN notation)

**Side note:** for very large values of "n" (100+), precision errors can arise due to floating point imprecision


### 2. What will this application do?

- The Riemman Sum calculator will serve as a desktop application designed to estimate integrals by using Riemman Sums of the left, midpoint, or right variety. 
- Given a relatively simple function (basic polynomial, trigonometric, exponential functions and more) and a partition width, this calculator will be able approximate integrals.
- A history of previous computations that can be saved and loaded from disk is also viewable

### 3. Example uses supported in the application

- As a user, I want to be able to compute left, right, midpoint sums.
- As a user, I want to add a Riemman Sum computation to a history of previous computations and view them.
- As a user, I want to remove the latest Riemman Sum computation from a history of previous computations.
- As a user, I want to be able to input basic fundamental trigonometric, logarithmic, or linear function to compute my Riemman sum.
- As a user, I want to save my current Riemman Sum computation and computation history to file.
- As a user, I want to load my current Riemman Sum computation and computation history from file.
